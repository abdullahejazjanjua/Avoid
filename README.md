# Avoid
# Hangman

- **Description:** This C++ program simulates a robot's movement in an obstacle-filled environment. It generates random sensor readings, stores them in an array, and uses a simple algorithm to determine the robot's optimal movement direction based on the maximum sensor value.
- **How to Run:**
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/abdullahejazjanjua/Avoid.git
     ```
  2. Compile the C++ code using Visual Studio Code.
     - Open the project folder in VS Code.
     - Use the integrated terminal to run:
       ```bash
       g++ avoid.cpp -o avoid
       ```
  3. Run the game.
     ```bash
